To start the app, download the neccesary dependencies (npm install)
- you need a https://www.themoviedb.org api key for this application, fill in the env file as neccesary, the code takes care of the rest
- setup a db for the backend, I used mongo db, but any non-relational database should work
- to start the app, simply run npm run start

This is a side project I did purely for fun while watching https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-css-11-hour-course/

Very helpful course, would recommend.
