# Movie Discovery App ðŸŽ¬

## Project Overview

This movie discovery application demonstrates modern web development techniques through a clean, interactive interface for exploring movies. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it showcases how powerful web applications can be created without heavy frameworks.

<CollapsibleSection title="Core Technologies" defaultOpen={true}>
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for accessibility and SEO
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with Flexbox/Grid layouts
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: ES6+ features for clean, maintainable code
</CollapsibleSection>

<CollapsibleSection title="Key Features Implemented">
- **Fetch API** for HTTP requests to movie database to fetch the movie data
- **Async/Await** patterns for handling asynchronous operations
- **Local Storage** for user user search query and the returned movies
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox** for responsive layouts
- **Intersection Observer** for lazy loading and infinite scroll
</CollapsibleSection>

<CollapsibleSection title="What I Learned">
This project enhanced my skills in:

- **API Integration**: Working with RESTful APIs and handling various response formats. 
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Mastering promises, async/await, and error handling
- **State Management**: Managing application state without external libraries
- **Performance Optimization**: Implementing caching, lazy loading, and efficient rendering
- **User Experience**: Creating intuitive interfaces with proper loading states and feedback
</CollapsibleSection>

<CollapsibleSection title="Technical Challenges Solved">
- **CORS Issues**: Implementing proper API request handling with proper exception handling
- **Rate Limiting**: Creating efficient request batching and caching for future queries
- **Responsive Images**: Implementing srcset and picture elements for optimal loading
- **Search Optimization**: Debouncing search inputs for better performance
- **Memory Management**: Preventing memory leaks in long-running applications by adding auto-closing of resources
</CollapsibleSection>

<CollapsibleSection title="Future Enhancements">
Potential improvements for this project:
- Migrate to a more flexible api
- Add user authentication and personal watchlists for a more personal experience
- Implement movie recommendation algorithms where both the user profile and a underlying recommendation algorithm would have to be implemented
- Add social features like reviews and ratings
- Create offline functionality with service workers
- Integrate with popular streaming service APIs like Amazon Prime and Netflix
- Add advanced filtering and sorting options
