# Interactive HTML Game ðŸŽ®

## Project Overview

This project showcases the power of vanilla web technologies by creating an engaging interactive game using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks, no libraries - just pure web fundamentals bringing old-school d&d-like entertainment to life. Would make it much longer if I had time.
It is a basic text-based game where the hero is trying to navigate a quest where an evil Dragon unleashes terrible fury to their town.
You can go to the cave to go monster hunting or go to shop to upgrade your equipment or restock. 

## What Makes It Special

## Technical Highlights

The game implements several interesting technical concepts:

- **Event handling** for user interactions (keyboard, mouse, touch)
- **Animation loops** using `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth gameplay
- **State management** to track game progress and user actions
- **Collision detection** algorithms for game mechanics
- **Local storage** integration for saving high scores or progress

## Key Features

- **Engaging Gameplay**: Intuitive mechanics that are easy to learn but challenging to master
- **Visual Appeal**: Clean, modern design with attention to visual details
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader friendly elements

## What I Learned

Building this game reinforced my understanding of:

- DOM manipulation and event handling best practices
- CSS animations and transitions for engaging user experiences
- JavaScript game loops and performance optimization
- Creating responsive designs without CSS frameworks
- The importance of clean, maintainable code structure

## Future Enhancements

Ideas for expanding this project:
- Add sound effects and background music
- Implement multiplayer functionality
- Create additional levels or game modes
- Add social sharing features for high scores
- Integrate with web APIs for enhanced features
