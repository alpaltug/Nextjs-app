# Interactive HTML Game ðŸŽ®

## Project Overview

This project showcases the power of vanilla web technologies by creating an engaging interactive game using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks, no libraries - just pure web fundamentals bringing old-school d&d-like entertainment to life. Would make it much longer if I had time.
It is a basic text-based game where the hero is trying to navigate a quest where an evil Dragon unleashes terrible fury to their town.
You can go to the cave to go monster hunting or go to shop to upgrade your equipment or restock. 

<CollapsibleSection title="Technical Highlights">
The game implements several interesting technical concepts:

- **Event handling** for user interactions (keyboard, mouse, touch)
- **Animation loops** using `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth gameplay with no bugs
- **State management** to track game progress and user actions
- **Collision detection** algorithms implemented via handler functions for game mechanics
- **Local storage** integration for saving progress

<CollapsibleSection title="Key Features">
- **Engaging Gameplay**: Intuitive mechanics that are easy to learn but and easier to exploit : 3
- **Visual Appeal**: Simple, old-school design; reminiscing of the older Zelda games.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on both desktop or mobile browsers. Should resize UI nicely for all devices.
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader friendly elements
