# Welcome to My Personal Website! ðŸŽ‰

Hello there! Welcome to my personal corner of the internet. I'm excited to share this space with you, where creativity meets code, and ideas come to life.

## What You'll Find Here

This website serves as my digital portfolio and playground, where I showcase the projects I've been passionate about. Rather than traditional blog posts, you'll discover interactive projects that demonstrate my love for all aspects of software development and creative problem-solving.

## My Journey

As a 23-year-old software programmer based in Seattle, WA. I have previously graduated from UC Berkeley with an honors degree in Electircall Engineering and Computer Science and have worked at Nokia Bell Labs. I am currently working at Amazon as a SDE,... (you can find more about me in the /about tab) 
I believe in learning by doing. Each project you'll find here is me attempting to learn the underlying technologies by creating mock aps - from simple HTML games to more complex applications. Every line of code tells a story of curiosity, experimentation, and growth.

## What's Next?

I'm constantly working on new projects and exploring different technologies. This website will evolve as I do, with new projects, and have updates from my software development journey!

Feel free to explore, interact with the projects, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate!
